# TASK 2- Creating a TO DO list App
# Overview
As part of my initial assignment during the internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I developed a Python program that contains a basic TO-DO list app implementation in
Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks from a list.
# App Algorithm
The app algorithm is based on a simple finite state machine that processes user input and updates the task list accordingly. The algorithm can be broken down into the following steps:
- **User Input:** The user enters a task or selects a task to edit or delete using the GUI.
- **Task List Update:** The app updates the task list based on the user input, adding, editing, or deleting tasks as necessary.
- **Task List Display:** The app displays the updated task list to the user.
# App Components
The app consists of the following components:
- **GUI:** The graphical user interface is implemented using Tkinter and provides a simple and intuitive way for users to interact with the app.
- **Task List:** The task list is implemented using a Listbox widget and stores the tasks entered by the user.
- **Task Entry:** The task entry field is implemented using an Entry widget and allows users to enter new tasks or edit existing tasks.
- **Add Task Button:** The add task button is implemented using a Button widget and adds new tasks to the task list when clicked.
- **Edit Task Button:** The edit task button is implemented using a Button widget and edits existing tasks in the task list when clicked.
- **Delete Task Button:** The delete task button is implemented using a Button widget and deletes tasks from the task list when clicked.
# Features:
- Task List: The app displays a list of tasks that the user can add, edit, and delete.
- Task Entry: The app allows users to enter new tasks or edit existing tasks using a text entry field.
- Add Task: The app allows users to add new tasks to the task list.
- Edit Task: The app allows users to edit existing tasks in the task list.
- Delete Task: The app allows users to delete tasks from the task list.

# Requirements:
- Python 3.x 
- Tkinter
