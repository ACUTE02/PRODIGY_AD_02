# TASK 2- Creating a TO DO list App
# Overview
As part of my initial assignment during the internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I developed a Python program that contains a basic TO-DO list app implementation in
Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks from a list.
# App Algorithm
The app algorithm is based on a simple finite state machine that processes user input and updates the task list accordingly. The algorithm can be broken down into the following steps:
- **User Input:** The user enters a task or selects a task to edit or delete using the GUI.
- **Task List Update:** The app updates the task list based on the user input, adding, editing, or deleting tasks as necessary.
- **Task List Display:** The app displays the updated task list to the user.
# Features:
- Task List: The app displays a list of tasks that the user can add, edit, and delete.
- Task Entry: The app allows users to enter new tasks or edit existing tasks using a text entry field.
- Add Task: The app allows users to add new tasks to the task list.
- Edit Task: The app allows users to edit existing tasks in the task list.
- Delete Task: The app allows users to delete tasks from the task list.

# Requirements:
- Python 3.x 
- Tkinter
